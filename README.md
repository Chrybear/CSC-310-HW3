Upon opening the program, the code for the first problem will automatically run.
	Should the user wish to alter it they will need to edit the code.
Beginning at line 176 and ending at 182 are the calls to alter the initiated stack "MinStack". The user may use any of the methods within the “Stack” class, pushing, popping, etc. The only restriction on what may be pushed is that it must be a numerical element.

Problem #2 asks the user for input directly. They are asked to enter an arithmetic expression, such as “1 + 2” where the program will return 3. The user may enter any such arithmetic expression, utilizing addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and comparison operators. If comparison operators are detected, the program will return whether the statement is true or false. 
When entering an expression, the user must include a single space between each number and operator. Values entered must be either numeric or one of the aforementioned operators.

For problem #3, it will again automatically run without direct user input. The input must already be in post-fix notation. Should the user with to change from the default “52+83-*4/" they will need to alter the value assigned to the variable “pf”, which is on line 197.
